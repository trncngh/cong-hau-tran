# Problem 1: Three ways to sum to n

Duration: You should not spend more than 2 hours on this problem.
Time estimation is for internship roles, if you are a software professional you should spend significantly less time.

## Task

Provide 3 unique implementations of the following function in JavaScript.
Input: n - any integer
Assuming this input will always produce a result lesser than Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER.
Output: return - summation to n, i.e. sum_to_n(5) === 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 === 15.

```
var sum_to_n_a = function(n) {
    // your code here
};

var sum_to_n_b = function(n) {
    // your code here
};

var sum_to_n_c = function(n) {
    // your code here
};
```

# Solution

## Requirements

Node installed on local machine

## Execution the following command to run the solution

`node summation.js`

Result will be displayed in the console
