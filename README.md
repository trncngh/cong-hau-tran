99tech code challenge

## Note

I have separated the problems into different folders. Each folder contains a README.md file that describes the problem and the solution.
In terms of my application (FrontEnd Dev), I have completed problem 1, 2, and 3. But as mentioned in the code challenge, I wanna try to solve all the problems for Full-Stack Engineer role, I acknowledge that currently you guys only open for Backend and Frontend roles. But I still wanna give it a try, hope you guys don't mind.
I moved the problem 6 to 4 because of the duplication.

If you got trouble installing the dependencies(like I had), please use yarn instead of npm.
